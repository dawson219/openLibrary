Hello good People from Fyle

This is my internship assignment for the internship role at Fyle

I am relatively new in Angular, but I have 9 months of Internship experience in React. So I decided to Do this Project in React. But I am a quick learner and I assure you I will be able to translate my React skills to Angular very soon.

To run this app on Local:
1 Clone this repository.
2 Run "npm install" to install the dependencies.
3 Finally run "npm start" to start the server.
